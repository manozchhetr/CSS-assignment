            </header>
            <p>You're on the phone with your girlfriend<br>
            She's upset, she's going off about something that you said<br>
            'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do</p>

            <p>I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night<br>
            I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like<br>
            And she'll never know your story like I do</p>

            <p>But she wears short skirts<br>
            I wear T-shirts<br>
            She's cheer captain<br>
            And I'm on the bleachers<br>
            Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find<br>
            That what you're looking for has been here the whole time</p>

            <p>If you could see<br>
            That I'm the one<br>
            Who understands you<br>
            Been here all along<br>
            So, why can't you see<br>
            You belong with me<br>
            You belong with me</p>

            <p>Walk in the streets with you in your worn-out jeans<br>
            I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be<br>
            Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself<br>
            "Hey, isn't this easy?"<br>
            And you've got a smile<br>
            That could light up this whole town<br>
            I haven't seen it in a while<br>
            Since she brought you down<br>
            You say you're fine I know you better than that<br>
            Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?</p>

            <p>She wears high heels<br>
            I wear sneakers<br>
            She's cheer captain<br>
            And I'm on the bleachers<br>
            Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find<br>
            That what you're looking for has been here the whole time</p>

            <p>If you could see<br>
            That I'm the one<br>
            Who understands you<br>
            Been here all along<br>
            So, why can't you see<br>
            You belong with me</p>

            <p>Standing by and waiting at your backdoor<br>
            All this time how could you not know, baby?<br>
            You belong with me<br>
            You belong with me</p>

            <p>Can't you see<br>
            That I'm the one<br>
            Who understands you?<br>
            Been here all along<br>
            So, why can't you see<br>
            You belong with me</p>

            <p>Standing by and waiting at your backdoor<br>
            All this time how could you not know, baby?<br>
            You belong with me<br>
            You belong with me<br>
            You belong with me</p>

            <p>Have you ever thought just maybe<br>
            You belong with me?<br>
            You belong with me</p>
